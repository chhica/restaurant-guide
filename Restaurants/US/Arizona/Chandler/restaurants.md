Si Señor Restaurant - New Mexican Cuisine
I like this restaurant because they offer three salsa types that are complimentary and very delicious with your tortilla chips. I don't think I have ever tried a green or white sauce with such a nice spicy kick. Their food is tasty. At the end, they also give you complimentary cinammon or plain sopaipillas. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
